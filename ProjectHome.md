### OVERVIEW ###

> For now, **UIMA Text Segmenter** is a [UIMA](http://uima.apache.org/) **wrapper
> for the java implementations of the segmentation algorithms C99 and
> TextTiling, written by Freddy Choi**, and used in the experiments described
> in _choi\_2000naacl_ (see wiki pages). These algorithms offer a text segmentation analysis
> at the discourse level essentially based on lexical cohesion measures.

> The UIMA wrapper uses the `uk.ac.man.cs.choif` package which comes from the
> `C99-1.2-release.tgz` file, initially released by Freddy Choi.
> This package was released under the following license:
> _Free for educational, research and other non-profit making uses only.
> Copyright 1999._
> All the source code is included in the current uima-text-segmenter release
> except the implementations of the Jeff Reynar's dotplotting algorithm
> (reynar\_1994, reynar\_1998, reynar\_1999) and Min-Yen Kan et al.'s Segmenter
> (kan\_et\_al\_1998) which were removed.

> License attached to the `fr.univnantes.lina.uima.textSegmenter` package
> is _Apache-2.0_.
